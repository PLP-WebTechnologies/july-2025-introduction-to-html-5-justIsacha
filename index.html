      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>My main goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer. 
        I'm currently focused on mastering the core frontend technologies: 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” building a solid foundation in responsive 
        design and interactive user interfaces. As I progress, I plan to dive 
        into backend development using Node.js, and work with databases like 
        MongoDB to build full web applications. I aim to create impactful, 
        user-friendly solutions and continuously grow as a developer through 
        real-world projects and collaboration.</p>
